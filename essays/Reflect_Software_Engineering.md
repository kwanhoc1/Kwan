## Estimation
At the start of this semester, I saw software engineering as the act of taking on the “hard part” so that others could have an easier experience using computers. My goal was to soften the hardness of reality by developing intuitive, efficient, and helpful software. Over the past few months, I’ve learned that achieving this goal requires much more than just writing code. It requires structured teamwork, thoughtful design, and an understanding of the broader systems that surround software. Through this course, I’ve gained insight into the deeper layers of software engineering, particularly in areas like Agile Project Management, Open Source Software Development, and Design Patterns. These concepts go far beyond web applications—they shape the way software can be reliably and ethically built in any context.

## Actual Implementation
One major takeaway from this experience was how overconfidence or lack of clarity in task scope can lead to underestimation. In one instance, I estimated that a task would take two hours, but it took me an extra hour. That was not it, the code worked but there was a small bug which I could not resolve for the whole day which drove me crazy. 

## Over Estimating vs Under Estimating
Additionally, the collective review of our spreadsheet data as a team helped highlight patterns—some team members consistently overestimated, while others underestimated. Discussing this in our Discord channel allowed us to adjust our strategies and understand that estimation is not just an individual skill, but one that benefits from shared team insight.

## Estimation Plan
In future projects, I plan to apply a more improved understanding of software engineering for the estimation. This experience showed me that consistent tracking and reflection are key to improving accuracy over time, and ultimately, to becoming a more reliable contributor in team-based software development.
