## "Soft"ware
What do software engineers do? Software engineers design, develop, and maintain softwares used on electronic devices. Now, what is a software? A software is a program developed to use computer efficiently. The goal of all software engineers is to develop efficient softwares. When someone makes a job look easy, it's either that someone is highly skilled or the job is actually easy. Making the job easy, that is software engineer's job. Software engineers are taking the hard part to make software users' job easy. That's how I see software engineering.

## Hard Part
Let's get deeper into the "hard part" of the software. Great software designs that are intuitive and efficient require lot of hard work and brilliant ideas. But before any of that, software engineering require solid foundation in engineering principles such as data structures and algorithms. It's like being able to explain a hard concept in simple words. To be able to do so, you need great understanding of the language you speak. To get to that level of software engineering is the hard part, to understand the concepts well enough to explain them to computers in the language computers speak.

## Softening the Hardness
My goal in software engineering is to make hard tasks in real-life easy. I want to soften the hardness of reality. Whether it is improving automation, optimizing system performance, or developing user-friendly applications, I would be more than happy to be of service to the people of various fields.
