## User Interface
For my entire life, I have only been a user, not a developer. Taking this course, I suddenly got to play with HTML and CSS, learning what the "back room" actually looks like. From time to time, I accidentally pressed F12 and saw lines of code forming the website I was on. Back then, I had no special feelings about it, but now, when I see it, I feel more inclined to look into it and learn how the website was built. Was it made using a UI framework or something else?

## Framework
Building a website from scratch without using a UI framework is like constructing a house with just bricks and cement. Living in the 21st century, there is absolutely no reason to build a house that way. There are more advanced building techniques, and it would be smarter to use those established methods. Using Bootstrap 5 is similarâ€”it is a framework library that provides pre-made UI components. Unless the goal is to create the most unique website, the frameworks that Bootstrap 5 provides can be quite useful.

## U and I
The experience derived from the UI is commonly known as UX. The UI framework that Bootstrap 5 provides makes it easy to design a webpage, but it does not guarantee a good user experience. When using a UI framework, UX is one of the most important things to consider. Even when relying on a UI framework, you should still put as much effort into designing the webpage as if you were building it from scratch. You should strive to understand the intent behind every part of the provided UI framework.
