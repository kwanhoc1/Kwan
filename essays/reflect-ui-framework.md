## User Interface
For my entire life, I have only been a user, not a developer. Taking this course, I suddenly got to play with HTML and CSS, learning about how the back room actually looks like. Time to time, I accidently pressed F12 and saw lines of code which is forming the website I was on. Back then, I had no special feelings about it, but now when I see it I feel more like looking into it and learn how the website was built. Was it made using UI framework or something else?

## Framework
Making a website out of scratch without using UI framework is like building a house with just bricks and cements. Living in the 21st century, there is absolutely no reason to built a house in such a way. There are more advanced building techniques and it would be smarter to use those known techniques when building a house. Using Bootstrap 5 is just like it. Bootstrap 5 is a framework library which provides premade UI. If it's not the case of making the most unique website, frameworks that Bootstrap 5 provide would be useful.
