## I. Introduction
Until I took ICS 314 this semester, I was not actively using AI for any of my classes. Taking ICS 314, I learned that smart usage of AI is helpful when learning new contents. I believe that AI usage in software engineering can enhance learning efficiency and problem-solving when used wisely. Tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Google Bard offer support for debugging, explanation, documentation, and even idea generation. Among these, I mostly used ChatGPT throughout ICS 314 for understanding concepts, debugging, and writing assistance.

## II. Personal Experience with AI:
Experience WODs:
For the experience WODs, I tried to reduce the usage of AI to the least. Most of the experience WODs had detailed instructional videos, so I didn’t feel the need to use AI. I believed it was important to build my own problem-solving skills first.

In-class Practice WODs:
Since in-class practice WODs were not graded, I relied on my understanding from the experience WODs. I occasionally used AI after completing them to compare my solution or clarify specific concepts.

In-class WODs:
For in-class WODs that I found confusing or difficult, I used ChatGPT to get unstuck. For example, during a functional programming WOD, I asked ChatGPT, “How do I use Underscore’s .map and .filter together to transform a list of objects?” The response helped me understand the method chaining better and apply it successfully.

Essays:
When writing essays, I used ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas and check grammar. It was helpful in improving the quality of my writing without completely depending on it.

Final project:
For the final project, I used AI to ensure the quality of my code and assist with debugging. I pasted the error messages into ChatGPT and asked, “Why is this error happening, and how can I fix it?” It often gave relevant suggestions that worked or helped point me in the right direction.

Learning a concept / tutorial:
This was definitely one of the most helpful uses of AI. Whenever I was confused about a concept, I asked ChatGPT for an explanation in simpler terms or with analogies.

Answering a question in class or in Discord:
Before asking a question on Discord, I would sometimes check with ChatGPT first to see if I could solve it on my own.

Asking or answering a smart-question:
I did not use AI to ask a smart-question, because I felt that formulating a smart question requires a deep understanding of what I don’t know and the ability to analyze the problem on my own.

Coding example:


Explaining code:
When I couldn’t understand a line of code, asked ChatGPT to explain what exactly the code was doing. 

Writing code:
When I wasn’t sure how to start writing a function, I used AI to brainstorm. 

Documenting code:
I did not use AI for this element, because I didn't really document them. But I understand the importance of documentation and I will get myself a habit of documenting code.

Quality assurance:
This was another one of the most  of using AI. When there were unidentified bugs, I asked ChatGPT what was wrong with the code and it gave me a few options I could try to fix the problem and it worked most of the times.


## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
Using AI in ICS 314 definitely improved my understanding of complex topics. It acted like a personal tutor available 24/7. I became more confident in exploring new concepts because I knew I had AI as a backup. However, I also learned to verify the answers carefully, as AI sometimes gave outdated or incorrect advice.

## IV. Practical Applications:
Outside ICS 314, I’ve started using AI for other classes and small personal projects. For example, when working on a website for a project for a different class, I used ChatGPT to write helper functions and fix CSS layout issues. I also used it to understand errors in other programming languages.

## V. Challenges and Opportunities:
One of the biggest challenges was knowing when to stop using AI. Sometimes I spent too much time refining a prompt to get a better answer instead of thinking through the problem myself. Also, AI could occasionally give incorrect solutions with confident-sounding explanations.

## VI. Comparative Analysis:
Compared to traditional teaching methods, AI-enhanced learning felt more interactive and flexible. I could ask unlimited questions without feeling embarrassed. However, it lacked the depth and context that a professor or TA could provide. Traditional methods offered more structured understanding, while AI gave quicker feedback. Using both together was the most effective for me.

## VII. Future Considerations:
I believe AI will become an even more integrated part of software engineering. Future advancements might allow AI to give more personalized feedback or help grade code more effectively. At the same time, it is important to teach students how to use AI critically and not become overly reliant. It should be a tool to enhance learning, not replace thinking.

## VIII. Conclusion:
Reflecting on my use of AI in ICS 314, I realized how much it helped me grow as a developer. From debugging and documentation to concept clarification, AI was a supportive tool throughout the course. Still, the key was to use it wisely and not depend on it entirely. With the right balance, AI can be a powerful ally in learning software engineering.
