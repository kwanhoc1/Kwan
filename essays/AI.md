## I. Introduction
Until I took ICS 314 this semester, 

## II. Personal Experience with AI:
Experience WODs:
For the experience WODs, I tried to reduce the usage of AI to the least. Also for the most of the experience WODs, there were videos with every steps so I didn't feel the neccessity of using AI.

In-class Practice WODs:
Since in-class practice WODs were not graded, I tried to do the practice WODs based on what I understood from the experience WODs.

In-class WODs:
I used AI for in-class WODs that I had no clue with.

Essays:
When writing an essay, I used AI to get an idea and grammar check.

Final project:
For the final project, I used AI to assure quality. When there were any errors for unknown reasons, I asked ChatGPT.

Learning a concept / tutorial:
This was definitely one of the most helpful way of using AI.

Answering a question in class or in Discord
Asking or answering a smart-question
Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
Explaining code
Writing code


Documenting code

Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”:
This was another one of the most  of using AI. When there were unidentified bugs, I asked ChatGPT what was wrong with the code and it gave me a few options I could try to fix the problem and it worked most of the times.
