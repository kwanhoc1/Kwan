## Estimation
I found it difficult to accurately predict the time certain tasks would require, especially when dealing with software engineering for only one semester. I think it is important to know where you are at in understanding software engineering to accurately estimate the time to be spent on an issue.

## Actual Implementation
One major takeaway from this experience was how overconfidence or lack of clarity in task scope can lead to underestimation. In one instance, I estimated that a task would take two hours, but it took me an extra hour. That was not it, the code worked but there was a small bug which I could not resolve for the whole day which drove me crazy. 

## Over Estimating vs Under Estimating
Additionally, the collective review of our spreadsheet data as a team helped highlight patternsâ€”some team members consistently overestimated, while others underestimated. Discussing this in our Discord channel allowed us to adjust our strategies and understand that estimation is not just an individual skill, but one that benefits from shared team insight.

## Estimation Plan
In future projects, I plan to apply a more improved understanding of software engineering for the estimation. This experience showed me that consistent tracking and reflection are key to improving accuracy over time, and ultimately, to becoming a more reliable contributor in team-based software development.
