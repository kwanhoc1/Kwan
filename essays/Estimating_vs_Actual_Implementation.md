## Estimation
I found it difficult to accurately predict the time certain tasks would require, especially when dealing with software engineering for only one semester. I think it is important to know where you are at in understanding software engineering to accurately estimate the time to be spent on an issue.

Design patterns aren't pieces of code you simply copy-paste into your project. They're guidelines or templates. They are your map application on your phone when going to a place you have never been. They help developers structure code in ways that are maintainable, efficient, and scalable. They aren’t silver bullets, but when applied thoughtfully, they can dramatically improve the flexibility and clarity of your software.

## Getting Through the Jungle
But why does using design patterns matter? Beyond merely solving problems, they allow for better communication between developers. Just as a blueprint speaks the same language to any architect, design patterns give developers a shared vocabulary for tackling complex problems. Instead of explaining every tiny detail, you can refer to the pattern, saving time and ensuring everyone on the team is on the same page.

In essence, design patterns are not just about solving problems—they're about creating a consistent framework for your solutions, making your code more readable, reusable, and resilient to change. As my projects evolve, I continue to explore new patterns, each time gaining a deeper appreciation for their power in creating well-designed software. Without design patterns, I would be lost in the jungle of codes.
