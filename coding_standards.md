## Makes Your Life Easier
Many programmers, especially those new to the field, tend to think of coding standards as arbitrary rules that get in the way of their free and wild coding style. That is absolutely not true. Coding standards are the key to making a programmer's life easier. Without coding standards, programmers would have to read thousands of lines of code from top to bottom just to find a single error. While these conventions do contribute to code readability, they represent only a small fraction of what coding standards truly offer. In my view, coding standards are among the most impactful software engineering techniques, essential for improving code quality, maintainability, and even for deepening one’s understanding of a programming language.

## To Be Collaborative
Let’s say I’m the only software engineer in the world, and no one else is ever going to touch my code. I would understand the code I wrote, how each function works, and exactly what they do. But that is not how the world works. We learn to code to collaborate with other people. It is important that others understand how my code works. That is exactly why coding standards exist. Following coding standards is the best way to be collaborative—perhaps even the only way.
