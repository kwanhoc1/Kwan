## To Be Collaborative
Let's say I'm the only software engineer in the world, and no one else is going to mess with my code. I would understand the code I wrote, how each function works and know exactly what they do. But that is not how the world is. We learn to code to collaborate with other people. It is important that the other people understand how my code works. That is exactly why coding standards exist. Following coding standards is the best way to be collaborative.
